21. The following violations of "netiquette" are grounds for immediate

    to have originated or transmitted these types of traffic.

    (a) Posting a single article or substantially similar articles to
        an excessive number of newsgroups (i.e., 20 or more) or
        continued posting of articles which are off-topic (e.g., off-
        topic according to the newsgroup charter or the article
        provokes complaints from the regular readers of the newsgroup
        for being off-topic).

    (b) Sending unsolicited mass emailings (i.e., to more than 25
        users) which provoke complaints from the recipients.

        GlobalCenter and using an account on GlobalCenter as a mail
        drop for responses.

        after being asked to stop by those individuals and by
        GlobalCenter.

    (e) Impersonating another user or otherwise falsifying one's user
        name in email, Usenet postings, on IRC, or with any other
        Internet service.  (This does not preclude the use of
        nicknames in IRC or the use of anonymous remailer services.)

        or any other.  Such software may not be stored on
        GlobalCenter servers.

    are also responsible for the cost of labor to clean up and respond

    governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of
    Arizona.

24. GlobalCenter may modify these terms and conditions upon notice
    published online via GlobalCenter. User's use of GlobalCenter
    services after such notice shall constitute User's acceptance of the
    modifications to this Agreement.

25. Non-enforcement of any section of this Agreement does not constitute
    consent and GlobalCenter reserves the right to enforce this
    Agreement at its sole discretion.

26. If any one or more paragraphs in this Agreement is found to be
    unenforceable or invalid, User's and GlobalCenter's agreement on all
    other paragraphs shall remain valid.

27. Monthly service charges must be paid on a timely basis to maintain
    User's membership privileges.  Monthly service charges will continue
    regardless of your use unless and until you notify us in writing
    that you wish to cancel your membership, which you may do at any
    time, unless bound by a specific term or agreement.  Payments more
    than 15 days late may be assessed a 5% late payment charge.

28. When paying by check, User expressly authorizes GlobalCenter to
    debit User's checking account for the amount of a check returned
    unpaid by User's bank, plus up to a $25 returned check fee.

29. The User is in default of this Contract if: (1) any User covered by
    this contract fails to obey any present or future GlobalCenter rule
    or regulation; or (2) GlobalCenter does not receive a monthly
    payment on or before its due date; or (3) any material statement by
    the User in this contract is false.

30. Failure to use this account(s) does not relieve the User of payment
    obligations, except as specifically provided in this contract.

31. In the event the User defaults on this contract, GlobalCenter may
    suspend or revoke the User's membership privileges and the User may
    have to reapply for membership at the price GlobalCenter is charging
    to new members. The User agrees to pay GlobalCenter's reasonable
    attorney's fees and court costs, where permitted, in collecting the
    amount remaining in the User's contract as stated in the sales
    order.

32. Communication systems are subject to degradation of service from
    phenomena such as so-called "Line-Noise" interference and other
    causes beyond the reasonable control of GlobalCenter.

    ownership of said service and commitment at any time without notice.

34. In addition to any price specified herein, User shall pay the gross
    amount of any present or future sales, use, excise, value added or
    other similar taxes applicable to the price, sales or delivery of
    any products or services furnished here under or to their use by
    customer.

35. GlobalCenter reserves the right to terminate or change priority of
    any process started by said user.

36. GlobalCenter reserves the right to collect damages (software,
    hardware and labor) if any harm is done to GlobalCenter which
    requires repair or reconfiguration of any kind.

37. GlobalCenter may offer a trial period during which the User may
    cancel membership without incurring any costs.  It is the
    responsibility of the User to contact GlobalCenter to cancel during
    the trial period and receive verification that cancellation has
    occurred.  Failure to use the account(s) does not constitute
    cancellation.

38. GlobalCenter may offer credits to users who refer additional users
    who sign up for and keep GlobalCenter accounts through at least one
    billing cycle, provided that the new users signing up mention at the
    time of signup the login name or accounting ID number of the user
    who referred them.

39. GlobalCenter unlimited interactive usage dialup connections are not
    intended to be full-time dedicated connections and will be
    disconnected after 30 minutes of inactivity.  User agrees not to use
    any automatic method to avoid disconnection, to keep the connection
    active only when the User is actively using it, and not to provide
    public information services over the connection.  GlobalCenter
    reserves the right to impose a restriction on accounts it deems to
    be in violation of these conditions.

40. In the event of cancellation of service, User is responsible for the
    full current month's charges unless cancellation is received by
    GlobalCenter by the end of the 25th of the previous month.
    Cancellation notice must be submitted by U.S. mail, email to
    cancel@primenet.com from the GlobalCenter account, or faxed to 602-
    416-9090. If you are submitting your cancellation via US Mail, you
    must write ATTENTION: CANCELLATION on the envelope.
