Latency
</B></CENTER></Font>

<P>
Latency is a measure of the quality of  your internet connection.<Br>
Many factors contribute to your latency<Br>
(including but not exclusive to the performance of your system and the speed of your 
internet service provider).  Your latency has a large impact on the speed of games you 
play over the internet, so we have developed a system for users to easily gauge their 
latency, and the latency of others.
</P>

<P>
Latency is represented on battle.net as the colored bars next to users' 
names in the chat channels, as the colored bars next to public games in the Join screen, 
and as the colored bars next to other players names in the Game Setup screen.  
The fewer the bars a user sees next to another user's or game's name, the lower the latency.  
The bars are color coded to further help users quickly gauge latency - green bars denote 
low latency, yellow bars denote medium latency, and red bars denote high.  
When looking for games to play or people to play with, keep latency in mind; playing in 
low latency games with low latency players will minimize lag within the game.
</P>

<P>
The latency bars you see next to players' names in the chat channels are determined 
by measuring the amount of time is takes to send and receive internet data between that 
player and the battle.net servers .  Your latency to a particular public game is 
determined by measuring the amount of time it takes to send and receive data between 
your computer and the computer of the public game's creator.  Your latency with respect 
to another player in the Game Setup screen is determined by measuring the amount of time 
it takes to send and receive data between that player's computer and your computer.  
In all cases, the less time it takes to for this data to travel from source to destination, 
the lower the latency.
