Where do I find a "null modem" serial cable?
</B>

<UL><LI>
Most computer supply stores stock cables appropriate for direct connect use.
Ask your salesperson for a "null modem serial cable" or "laplink serial cable"
</LI>

<LI>
Also, there are many cables designed for Microsoft Windows 95 direct cable networking.
Any serial cable designated for use with Win95 direct cable networking will work with
Starcraft direct connection games.
</LI>

<LI>
Parallel cables are not compatible with Starcraft direct connection games.

<P><B>
You can use HyperTerminal to determine which COM port your null
modem cable is using and to verify your null modem cable is working properly.

Click on "Start"

<LI>
Click on "Programs"
</LI>

<LI>
Click on "Accessories"
</LI>

<LI>
Click on "HyperTerminal"
</LI>

<LI>
Double click on "Hypertrm"
</LI>

<LI>
Click on "choose a name"
</LI>

<LI>
Click on "OK"
</LI>

<LI>
Select the COM port you have the Direct Link Cable plugged into<Br>
<Ul>(if you don't know what COM port you have the cable plugged into you will want to call the computer manufacturer to determine the COM port number)</Ul>
</LI>

<LI>
Click on "OK" two times
</LI>

<LI>
Now start HyperTerminal on the another machine that you wish to communicate with<Br>
<Ul>(same method as above)</Ul>
</LI>

<LI>
By typing at the blinking cursor (you might not be able to see anything you type), 
the text should appear on the other computer’s monitor. If you have tried all 
possible COM port combinations between the computers and still fail to communicate 
between them, chances are you do not have a null modem cable or you have a 
<a href="Comport.htm">hardware conflict between the null-modem cable & another piece of hardware.</a>
