COMMON CONFIGURATIONS
</B></P></CENTER></FONT>

<P><Li>
A PC with a PS/2 mouse, two serial ports, and no internal modem or other serial devices.
Since the PS/2 style mouse, which is common on most modern machines, 
does not plug into a serial port, there shouldn't be any IRQ conflicts with other serial devices.   
Verify that there is no IRQ conflict between the two serial ports 
(you don't have to worry about this if the COM ports are 1 and 2 or 3 and 4).  
If everything checks out, this machine can be a router.
</Li></P>

<P><Li>
A PC with a PS/2 mouse, two serial ports, and an external modem.
This is very similar to the previous setup, except that the external modem uses a COM port 
(i.e. unlike an internal modem that generates and uses its own COM port).  
This machine can be used as a router if you disconnect the external modem.

<P><Li>
A PC with a PS/2 mouse, two serial ports, and an internal modem.
Determine whether there is any resources conflict between the serial ports and the modem.  
If the internal modem shares an IRQ with a COM port, or creates a conflict, 
you need to resolve this by:
</Li>

<Ul><Li>
a) Disabling the modem in Device Manager if it is a Plug and Play (PnP) modem 
</Li>

<Li>
b) physically removing the modem card if the modem is not PnP.  
If you are unsure on how to do any of the above, please contact your modem manufacturer. 
This computer can only act as a router if there are no IRQ conflicts present.

<P><Li>
A PC with a serial mouse, two serial ports, and no internal modem or other serial devices.
Since your mouse permanently occupies a serial port, this machine cannot act as a router, 
and must instead be placed at the end of a daisy chain of connected computers.
