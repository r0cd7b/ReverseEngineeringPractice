While this is rare, performance degradation is usually related to low memory conditions.

Try disabling music on all systems and make sure that you have closed
all unneeded programs prior to running Starcraft.
</Li>

<Li>
If you are not sure what programs are needed for your sytem
to run please contact your Computer manufacturer.
</Li>

<Ul><Li>
To close the unneeded programs:
</Li>

<Ul><Li>
Press (ctrl, alt, del) at the same time.
</Li>

<Li>
When the Close program menu appears it will show a list of programs.
</Li>

<Li>
Select one of the programs you want to close and click on end task.
</Li>

<Li>
If you see a message about one of the programs click ok or end task again.
</Li>

<Li>
You will then need to reopen the Close program menu and continue
this untill only the programs you want are in the list.
</Li>

<Li>
Note: Normally you only need "Explorer" to run windows,
this can differ with each computer system.
</Li></Ul></Ul>

<Li>
If this does not help, try disabling sound. Also please take note that slower
video cards can affect the network performance. This is due mostly to Starcraft
trying to equalize the performance over the network connection.
</Li>

<Li>
If none of these solutions fix the problem, it is possible that you have
some sort of hardware conflict either in your network or in one or more
of the systems playing.
