BATTLE.NET NOT RESPONDING
</B></P></Center></Font>

<P><Li>
Battle.net is taken down for maintenance from time to time.
</Li>

<Li>
If you receive the error rarely, then chances are Battle.net
is either actually down and will be running again shortly,
or your connection to the Internet is very poor.
</Li>

<Li>
In either case, give it an hour or so and attempt to re-logon
to Battle.net.  You should succeed at that point.
</Li>

<Li>
If you get this message every time you try to connect to Battle.net
you will want to first try an alternate phone number for your ISP.
</Li>

<Li>
If that does not help, contact your ISP to see if there
are any problems with their service.
</Li>

<Li>
If you are having continuing problems, contact our
<A HREF="../Info/Contact.htm">Technical Support Department.</A>
