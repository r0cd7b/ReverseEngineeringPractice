What does "The Plug" mean?
</B>

<Ul><Li>
"The plug" icon means for some reason or another, your computer is not processing
UDP packets correctly.  Therefore you will not be able to connect to
Battle.net and play Starcraft until this is fixed.
</Li>

<Li>
Typically there are four reasons that you would not be processing UDP packets.
</Li>

<Ul><Li>
The first is that your Internet connection is not accepting or sending UDP packets
on port 6112 which is required by battle.net and Starcraft.  If this is the case
you will want to talk to your Internet provider to see if they can open this port.
</Li>

<Li>
Another reason for this error is caused by using proxy software.  For information
on Proxy software <A HREF="proxy.htm">click here</A>.
</Li>

<Li>
If you have internet messaging utilities running in the background they may cause problems.
</Li>

<Li>
The final reason for receiving this error is caused by a poor connection to the Internet.
</Li></Ul>

<Li>
If you receive this error randomly, try disconnecting from Battle.net and the
Internet then reconnect. This should clear it up.
