TIME OUTS
</B></P></Center></Font>

<P><Li>
When the communications in a game are interrupted, each computer is given a certain
amount of time to re-establish the link with the other computers in the game.
</Li>

<Li>
Each computer that fails to re-establish communications is "timed out"
and dropped from the game to allow the others to continue playing.
</Li>

<Li>
This may happen if either your computer or your internet connection cannot 
keep up with the activity of the other players in the game.
The more players that are in a game, the more both have to work.
</Li>

<Li>
Contact your ISP and ask them what your latency to the Internet is.  If it is 500ms or higher 
this can cause you to be disconnected from battle.net and disconnected from games.
</Li>

<Li>
If this happens to you often, contact your ISP for information on
ways of decreasing your latency or increasing your bandwidth.
