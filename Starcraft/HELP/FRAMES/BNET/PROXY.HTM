USING PROXIES

<!---------------------- Note --------------------------------!>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><P>Note:</FONT>
The use of proxies to connect computers to battle.net is officially unsupported by Blizzard. 
However we realize that as the number of households with multiple networked computers grows, 
proxies are becoming a popular inexpensive method of allowing multiple computers to gain access 
to the Internet. We will try to pass along as much information as possible to assist users in 
the setup of their proxies to allow play over battle.net. Most all of the proxy setup 
information we currently have was sent in by users like yourself.
</P>

<P>
At this time we do not have any information regarding Starcraft 
connecting to Battle.net using proxy software.
</P>

<P>
If you are trying to setup your proxy software please note that Starcraft sends all information over port 6112.

<P>
If you are successful in configuring proxy software programs to work with Starcraft, 
please email <A Href="mailto:Support@Blizzard.com">support@blizzard.com</A> details of the configuration settings so that we may 
help other customers in a similar situation.
</P>
