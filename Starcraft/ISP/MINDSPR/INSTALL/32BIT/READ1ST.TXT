Runtime Error 367 : Cannot load or register custom control: ESRAS32.OCX

	1  With MindSpring PipeLine+ closed, click Start, then click Run.
	2  Type regsvr32 esras32.ocx then click OK.
	3  Click OK. You should see the confirmation DLLRegisterServer 
	   in esras32.ocx succeeded.
	4  Restart Windows95.
	5  If the install program does not auto-launch you will need to 
	   launch it.  To do so:
		Click on Start
		Click on Run
		Type "c:\pipeplus\bin\mssetup" without the quotes.
		Press [Enter].
	6  Make sure that your UserID is correct, that Mailbox has your 
	   primary Mailbox name, and that Domain reflects your email address.

  
Error 691: Authentication Failure

	This error indicates that either your UserID or its password are 
	entered incorrectly into MindSpring PipeLine+.	To update your 
	password in MindSpring PipeLine+

	1  Open PipeLine+, and click Configure.
	2  Verify the information in the User ID field. Remember to use 
	   the correct letter case, and to differentiate between a zero 
	   (0) and the letter O (o).
	3  Click Login Password, and enter information as follows:

	   Current Password:
	   Leave blank.

	   New Password:
	   Type your password.

	   Verify Password:
	   Type your password again.

	4  Click OK, then click OK again.

  
Runtime Error 75

	This error usually results when the MindSpring Installer attempts 
	to run MSSetup while other applications are active. If you receive 
	this error, close all applications, including Norton Desktop, and 
	any virus protection software, then run MSSetup.  To run MSSetup:

	1 With MindSpring PipeLine+ closed, click Start, point to Programs, 
	  then click MindSpring PipeLine+ v2.6-32.
	2 Double-click MSSetup.
	3 Complete the PipeLine+ Setup window. Make sure that your UserID 
	  is correct, that Mailbox has your primary Mailbox name, and that 
	  Domain reflects your email address.
	4 Click OK.

	Port disconnected due to hardware failure
	This error indicates that your modem is not properly installed. You 
	will need to un-install your current modem, reinstall it, then run 
	MSSetup (see To run MSSetup).
  

Error 602: Port already open

	This error occurs during connection, and indicates that another 
	application has control of the port on which your modem is installed. 
	If you receive this error, disable any non-MindSpring communications 
	applications, including fax and voicemail applications. Then try to 
	connect again. It may be necessary to restart your computer, if you 
	receive this error after disabling other communications software.
  

Error 502: You have no permission to talk

	This error appears most often when a MindSpring customer whose email 
	address is mailbox@pipeline.com has news.mindspring.com selected as 
	his or her news server, rather than news.pipeline.com (possibly as 
	a result of accepting the default domain, "mindspring," during 
	installation). This conflict can be changed in the PipeLine+ Setup 
	window. See To run MSSetup.

 
Could not log into the mail server. Check your username and password.
Could not retrieve usage stats...
Could not retreive message of the day...

	MindSpring PipeLine+ is designed to accomplish three tasks immediately 
	after a connection is established: check for mail waiting, check your 
	account usage statistics, and display the MindSpring Daily Announcements. 
	If you receive any one of the above messages, but are able to connect 
	successfully (evidenced by the ability to load Web pages in Internet 
	Explorer), chances are that your UserID or Mailbox, or Domain are not 
	set correctly in MindSpring PipeLine+. 
	
	All user information, including your domain, can be set from the program 
	MSSetup (see To run MSSetup).
 

Error 731: Protocol not configured

	We're still looking for the definitive set of circumstances in which this 
	error occurs, but it appears to be related to failed installation of DUN 
	or TCP/IP. As a remedy, we will need to remove Dial-Up Networking and 
	MindSpring PipeLine+, then reinstall. To remove Dial-Up Networking

	1 Click Start, then point to Settings and click Control Panel.
	2 Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
	3 Click the Windows Setup tab, and double-click Communications.
	4 De-select Dial-Up Networking.
	5 Click OK, then click OK again.

	To un-install MindSpring PipeLine+

	1 Click Start, then point to Programs and click 
	  MindSpring PipeLine+ v2.6-32.
	2 Double-click Uninstall MindSpring.
	3 Click Yes.
	4 Delete the Pipeplus folder. 
	  Now you are ready to re-install MindSpring PipeLine+.

  
Rasapi32.dll

	If you receive errors involving the file rasapi32.dll, first restart 
	your computer and run MSSetup (see To run MSSetup). If the error still 
	occurs, you will need to uninstall Dial-Up Networking (see To remove 
	Dial-Up Networking), then run MSSetup once again.
